Which volcanoes are likely to cause the most damage if they blow?

```{r}
# Number of deaths already known
volcano_deaths <- left_join(volcano_deaths, volcanoes, by = "volcano_name")
```

```{r}
volcano_deaths <- volcano_deaths %>% 
  drop_na(volcano_number)
```

```{r}
volcano_deaths = 
  select(volcano_deaths, -country.y)
```

```{r}
volcano_deaths = 
  rename(volcano_deaths, country = country.x)
```
